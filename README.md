# VCriate Task - Product Flow Builder

## Requirements

Fetch Products: On app load, fetch from https://dummyjson.com/products. Show a basic list or modal with these products.

Add Nodes: Allow the user to pick a product and add it as a "node" (show product name/price) on a blank "flow" area.

Connections: Let the user drag from one node's anchor to another to form an "edge" (arrow). They can also remove edges (and optionally remove nodes).

Data Flow: Use at least two components (e.g., ProductList, FlowEditor, Node) and pass data cleanly.
